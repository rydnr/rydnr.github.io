I've been warning people for years! The proof that I wasn't wrong! :D
<h1 class="title">Spreadsheets and the Financial Collapse</h1>
"[..]
We summarise the available evidence and suggest that there is a
link between the use of spreadsheets and the recent collapse of the
global financial system. We provide governments and regulating
authorities with some simple recommendations to reduce the risks of
continued overdependence on [..] spreadsheets.

P.D.: I hope this time censorship doesn't prevent this from publication, as in yesterday's post ;). Is there a problem with the wp installation? Sometimes it complains about missing folders, it takes you back and forth from argoblog to devblog. Yesterday I thought a post of mine would appear, but now it is as if it never existed.
