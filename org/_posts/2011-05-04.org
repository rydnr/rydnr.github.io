* Windows beware!

I wanted to provide a link to a new (free) <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx">Microsoft tool</a> aimed towards removing malware and spyware. It possibly complements <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/">Security Essentials</a> (which has recently failed me to detect some viruses, so beware). For some reason, the strategy this time is to force you to download the tool every 10 days.

Anyway, there's also an interesting guide regarding <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/factsheets/Best_Practices_Datasheets.pdf">Best practices for keeping your home network secure</a> from the NSA.
