* Programming Top 10 lists, according to 6 guys

Here it <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/top-6-list-of-programming-top-10-lists.html">is</a>.

It'd be interesting to publish our own top-10 list. That would tell a lot about each one of us!
But meanwhile, the easy way out:

- Jerry Weinberg: +1
- Dare Obasanjo: 0 (some +1, some -1)
- Omar Shahine: +1 (mostly)
- Michael McDonough: -1
- Andres Taylor: 0
- Steve Yegge: +1
