* Apache Shiro

I've just come across <a href="http://shiro.apache.org">Apache Shiro</a>.
It seems that Apache is again pushing forward framework-agnostic improvements to painful-to-use Java specs, in this case JAAS.

Has anyone used it already?

Reading its 10-minute tutorial, it seems it includes an abstraction to Session, which can be used outside HTTP and supports features such as clustering.
