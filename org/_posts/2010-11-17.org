* HTTPS secure?

I hope this is not too much off-topic.

All https sites state that they (us) offer secure services just by provide them via https with a trusted certificate.
The trust comes from an external authority (which on the other hand is just selling trust for money, so it's kind of ironic).
The only problem seems to be man-in-the-middle attacks, which affect only naive users that don't pay enough attention to their browsers' warning messages.

However, it's a fact that some IDS allow sniffing over SSL channels, upon providing them the certificates the host is using. And not only that: the SSL encryption often (as in our case) ends on the external layer of the IT systems (AJP is not encrypted). From the user's perspective is not really a difference, since she knows little about how her information is used on the other end (although she should worry about someone else knowing now her password).

My point is: the trust from the user's point of view comes from a) the company has paid for a certificate signature from a 'trustworthy' CA (I'm not buying that with enthusiasm, but could be worse); b) the company is able to detect -and defend itself- from external attacks. If they're not able to detect the attack, they could be sniffing our SSL data. One of the most valuable assets in a company is the certificate's key file. Protecting it doesn't make the service 'secure', but losing it opens up a lot of uncomfortable possibilities.

The SSL claim is too weak. And stating that our customers can feel confident just by using a valid and trusted certificate is just not true. It should be accomplished with policies like PCI, but they don't usually review in detail that you're telling the truth.

So yes, your certificate is valid, so what?
