* ORMs a thing of the past

It seems there's been new discussions about this topic lately.

Here's the post: <a href="http://codemonkeyism.com/orms">ORMs are a thing of the past</a>

And some responses:

In my opinion, I don't like ORMs either. But I'm actually more inclined to rethink why is that we build our architectures based on a single (conceptually at least) database? And it seems there're some others advocating the end of SQL:

And, a worth-reading for sure: <a href="http://adamblog.heroku.com/past/2009/7/6/sql_databases_dont_scale/" target="_blank">SQL databases don't scale</a>
