* Misusing statistics

Great <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html">article</a> about common practices in our industry. I've felt myself embarrased, even though I tend to convince myself I deserve less severe punishment since I have read some of the mentioned books and have the "Introductory statistics with R" in my desktop :).

Nice reading anyway.
