* The ultimate tool for automating repetitive tasks or GUI testing

At first glance, it'd say it's a killer <a href="//sikuli.org/">app</a> !!
It's like expect but not constrained to the command-line. I'm guessing it can be used for overcoming once and for all the nightmare of QA when it comes to Flash.
Additionally, it could be useful as Eclipse macro engine (in case it doesn't have one already). At least, for creating receipts or similar stuff... I'm thinking of all you unfortunate non-Emacs users :).

There's also another <a href="//www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/">tool</a> that seem to be competing, but only for Windows. None of them works yet on Linux, though :(.
