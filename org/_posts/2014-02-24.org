* In praise of "final" :)

<p>Sorry if this is easy. It came up recently as a nice surprise to me, but I think I knew it already... If only I had better memory...</p>

<p>Let's say you have a class such as:</p>

<pre>public class A {
    private static boolean DEBUG = false;
    static {
        if (DEBUG) {
            Log log = ...;
            log.debug("Static initialization"),
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>What if you define the DEBUG variable as "final"? Does it make any difference (besides the obvious of making it read-only)? How?</p>
